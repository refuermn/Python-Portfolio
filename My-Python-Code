print("Hello" + "Angela")
# This will print HelloAngela
# To concatenate all you need to do is add 2 or more "<characters here>" separated by the + symbol.

print("Hello" + " " + "Angela")
# I added a space between the words so that it will now print Hello Angela.

# In this example I am including an input command in my code.
# I also include a print function to say the word Hello.
print("Hello " + input("What is your name?"))

# Person types in their name
# When executed this will say Hello <typed in name> since the user must type in characters.
